# Naming: where every name in this tree comes from

Every identifier in `src/` and `include/` is in one of the classes below. The class decides how much
to trust the name and what evidence a rename needs (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`, "Proposing a rename").
Counts are from the date given next to them; the placeholder counts go down as fields are identified.

## Functions: the vendor's names, from the debug symbol files

The `G4BE08` discs are a debug build. They ship `files/Bio4.sym` for `main.dol` and one
`files/Bio4.<mod>.sym` per REL module. Those files list every function with its address, size and
its demangled name without a parameter list (`cAtariInfo::init`, `CameraControl::HermiteExport`;
`python3 tools/re4sym.py orig/G4BE08/files/Bio4.sym` prints them). `config/G4BE08/sym_map.tsv` and
`config/G4BE08/modules/<mod>/sym_map.tsv` are those tables, one row per symbol: address, size, section,
unit, scope, the linker symbol, the readable name. Every function in the tree is defined under its
row's name; the build fails to link otherwise.

The linker symbols in `sym_map.tsv` are GNU v2 C++ manglings (`HermiteExport__13CameraControlP9CameraCutPUc`
is `CameraControl::HermiteExport(CameraCut*, unsigned char*)`). The class, member and overload structure
in them is the vendor's (the `.sym` names carry it); the parameter types are OURS: the `.sym` has none,
so each mangling was written from the declaration this tree gives the function, and it changes when the
declaration does. A mangled symbol is therefore not evidence for a parameter type. Parameter types come
from the code (which registers a function reads and how) and, where a twin exists, from the PS2 debug
symbols (below); when a declaration is retyped, its `sym_map.tsv`/`symbols.txt` row is re-mangled to
match (PRs #5/#7 did this for ~75 functions; `git log -S'<old mangling>' -- config/G4BE08/sym_map.tsv`).
Int/float order between the two register classes is not observable in the bytes (ints fill r3.., floats
f1.., each in declaration order), so the PS2 order is taken. The game code is `.cpp` because of the
class structure the `.sym` shows. The units that are `.c` are
the ones whose symbols are unmangled C names: the newlib pieces linked into the DOL (`src/game/atof.c`,
`fopen.c`, ...), the Nintendo SDK (`src/lib/OS*`, `GX*`, ...), the CRI middleware (`src/lib/adx_*`,
`sfd_*`, `mpv_*`, ...) and SN's runtime. The exception is SN's libm (`src/lib/sf_sin.cpp`, ...): fdlibm
C sources included from a `.cpp` wrapper because ProDG compiled them through the C++ front end (the
wrapper's comment says why it matters for the data layout). Tree totals: 635 `.cpp`,
380 `.c`, no `.s` (2026-09-22; the eight asm-bodied units are `.c`/`.cpp` files whose functions are
top-level `asm()` bodies, see `README.md`).

Scope in the `.sym` (`local`/`global`) is not reliable and is corrected from use (`docs/matching.md`,
"Matching rules of thumb": "Bio4.sym scopes are unreliable").

Functions and labels without a vendor name keep a generated name: `fn_<addr>` for a code block the
`.sym` does not name (linkonce copies the module linker kept but did not list, see `docs/matching.md`
"Multi-object modules"), `lbl_<addr>` for an unnamed data object. 28 such names remain in `src/` and
`include/` (3 `fn_`, 25 `lbl_`; 2026-09-22, `rg -o 'fn_\w+|lbl_\w+' src include --no-filename | sort -u | wc -l`).
Do not replace them with invented names: a `lbl_` that is an unused `.sdata` global must keep its name for the
section layout to match (`docs/matching.md`, the rule of thumb on unused `.sdata` globals with no
`Bio4.sym` name).

## Files and unit boundaries: from the HALT strings and the symbol files

The vendor's source file names survive in the binaries. The `HALT`, `dbgAssert`, `MEM_ALLOC` and
`VECNormalize` macros expand `__FILE__`, so the `.rodata` of each object contains strings such as
`"D:/Bio4/Prog/em2d.cpp"`. A unit in this tree is named after that string (`src/em2d/em2d.cpp`).
Where one REL was linked from several objects, the
boundary between them is read from the `.sym` (function-name prefixes, the order of the header strings
each object emitted) and the HALT strings; `docs/matching.md`, "REL modules" and "Multi-object modules",
gives the method and the per-module results (for example `st1_0 = r100.cpp, r120.cpp, st1.cpp`).

Directory names are the module names from the disc: `em<xx>` enemies, `pl<xx>` players, `wep<xx>`
weapons, `st<n>_<m>` stages, `t_*`/`Tools` the debug tools, `Sscrn` the sub-screen. `src/game/` is the
DOL.

## `#line` directives

`#line 375 "D:/Bio4/Prog/cSceObj.cpp"` before a statement sets the line number the preprocessor
reports. The vendor's asserts, `HALT`s and `MEM_ALLOC` calls put `__LINE__` into strings and
immediates, and those values are part of the original bytes. Our source has different line numbers from
the vendor's, so each such site is preceded by a `#line` that restores the vendor's number and file
name. There are 738 of them in 312 files (2026-09-22, `rg -c '^\s*#\s*line' src include`). They are
not noise and must not be moved or removed. They also record roughly how long the vendor's file was and
where in it a function sat.

## Structs, fields, enums: three classes

The binaries have no type information for the game's data. Field names come from three sources, in
decreasing order of confidence.

### 1. Vendor names from the PS2 debug build

The PlayStation 2 port has a debug build dated Aug 28 2005 whose ELF carries a `.mdebug` section with
STABS type information: every struct, field, enum and function signature the PS2 compiler saw.
`stdump` from [chaoticgd/ccc](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ccc) turns it into C declarations;
`orig/ps2/ps2_types.h`, `orig/ps2/ps2_functions.h` and `orig/ps2/ps2_globals.h` are that output.
(`orig/` is not committed; the files are produced from your own copy of the PS2 ELF.)

The PS2 layouts do not match the GameCube layouts byte for byte: `Vec` is 16 bytes on the PS2 and 12
here, `Mtx` is 0x40 and 0x30, fields were added, removed and repacked in the port. So the fields are
matched by sequence, type and the names already known, never by raw offset. `tools/ps2sym.py` does
that: it aligns each GC struct against its PS2 counterpart (a sequence alignment scored on type
compatibility, existing-name equality and array dimensions, then a confidence from how well the
neighbours align once the `Vec`/`Mtx` growth is accounted for), writes a rename plan and applies it
to the declaration lines; the compiler then reports every use site, which the tool renames in turn.
Bytes never change under a rename; the clean rebuild check enforces that.

`python3 tools/ps2sym.py --struct <Name>` prints the alignment side by side (GC field, PS2 field,
confidence, reasons). A GC field with a PS2 field on its right at confidence 1.00 is a vendor name.
Where the vendor renamed a type between the ports, the alias table at the top of `ps2sym.py` says so
(`Em10Work` is the PS2's `FREE_EM10`, `MotionWork` is `MOTION_INFO`). Type names in the `sym_map.tsv` manglings
(`P10MotionWork`) are this tree's spellings, not vendor evidence; the `.sym` names carry class names
only.

Parameter types follow the PS2 prototype where a twin exists (`ps2_functions.h`; `ps2sym.py --params`
renamed 434 functions' parameters from it): a pointer or a callback where we had `int`, the PS2 float
order, the return type. The mangled symbol in `sym_map.tsv` is updated to the new declaration in the
same commit (see above; it is not evidence). Type names that appear in those manglings are the GC
spelling only where the `.sym`'s demangled names show it (`MotionWork` is ours; the PS2's `MOTION_INFO`
is the vendor's, and `docs/matching.md` notes the alias). Casts left at a call because "the mangling
pins the parameter" are not justified and are removed as the audit reaches them.

The tool aligns on names first, so a wrong name already in the header can pull a PS2 field onto the
wrong row. `Em10Work` had that: the `Vec` at 0x4EC, between `Keep_pos` and `Return_ck_pos` exactly as
the PS2's `Route_target` is, had been named `Goto_pos`, and the real `Goto_pos` (0x5F0, between
`Target_pos` and `Scale` as on the PS2) was a placeholder. When the row order around a field disagrees
with the tool's name match, the row order wins (2026-09-21: `Route_target` / `Target_pos` / `Goto_pos`).

The 2026-09-22 audit of the names that were already in the headers against the PS2 dump renamed
some 500 fields of the paired structs to the vendor spelling and found 15 mislabels (a GC name that
contradicted the PS2 field at the same place, with the use sites agreeing with the PS2: `cPlNeck`
`motL`/`motR` swapped, `LevelPrice` `mag`/`speed` shifted by one, `GlobalWork` `sub_pos` = `pl_pos`,
`Espgen42Work` `damp`/`spread` = `Prm_a`/`Prm_dmp`, ...). Two rules from it: a GC debug string that
prints the field beats the PS2 name (`db_work.cpp` prints `"pCldShMd"`, so `cModel::pCldShMd` keeps
that spelling over the PS2 `pChildShadowModel`; `"L PL"` confirmed `cEm::l_pl`); and the `Em10Work`
timer block (`Esc_timer` .. `Claw_hp`, 0x644-0x686) is repacked relative to `FREE_EM10` (0x3a8-0x3ca),
so those names rest on the local runs of neighbours and the use sites, not on the whole-struct row order.

Enums (`EM_STATUS`, `DATA_COMMAND`, `SCE_LEVEL`, `ESP_OWNER`, `DMG_TYPE`, `ACTION_TYPE`, ...) are
imported from the same dump as declared there: the PS2 enumerator names and values, in the PS2 order,
in the header of the GC unit that owns the type (`ps2_types.h` is the reference; `rg 'enum NAME'
include` finds the copy). Where an enum was introduced, the magic constants at typed call sites were
replaced with its enumerators and the parameter types left alone; an enumerator is never renamed.
Two documented exceptions. `ESP_OWNER` (esp.h) carries GC values: the PS2 names at the index of the
same name in eff_sys.cpp `owner_name_tbl`, the GC table lacking EM3F/EM4E/EM4B/WEP51, so the PS2
values shift by the missing rows. Enums whose GC numbering differs from the PS2 in a way the code does
not pin down are not imported; the sites keep their literals. The nested `cObjMgr::ID` / `cDmgMgr::ID`
keep the PS2 nesting because the three `enum ID`s share constant names.

The flag enums live in `include/global.h` next to the `GlobalWork` words they index: `DBG_FLAG`
(`Debug_flg`), `STA_FLAG` (`Status_flg`), `SYS_FLAG`, `KEY_FLAG`, `CFG_FLAG`, `EXT_FLAG`, with the
PS2 enumerator names. A bit is read and written through the `XxxFlagChk/On/Off(pG, NAME)` macros of
the same header (`DbgFlagChk`, `StaFlagOn`, `KyfFlagOff`, ...; `FlagChk(base, no)` is the generic form
over a word array); bit `no` is bit `31 - (no & 31)` of word `no >> 5`, the numbering of the
t_flag.cpp tables and of the PS2 enums. Whole-word reads stay where the codegen needs the word
(`u32 flags = pG->Status_flg[3]` in r20f/r210, the tools' save/restore copies in t_util); a
single-bit mask test written on the raw word is a site not yet converted, not a second convention.

`Room_flg` has no global enum: the bits mean something different in every room. The rooms whose
flags the PS2 build names (`enum ROOM_FLAG` blocks, matched to a GC room by the set of bits its code
uses) have an `enum R<xxx>_FLAG { RMF_... }` at the top of the room source (`r320.cpp`, `r30f.cpp`),
or in the header of the object that shares the bits (`objRobo.h` r226, `em2b.h` r119, `pl14.h` r11c),
and use `RmfFlagChk/On/Off`; every other room keeps the raw mask, since there is no vendor name to
give the bit.

### 2. Names given from usage by the decompilers

Where the PS2 dump has no counterpart for a field (the struct was reorganised, or the field is
GameCube-only), the field was named from what the code does with it. These names are guesses. They
are recognisable in two ways: the field's line comment names the use (`cModelInfo* pRobe; // ...
type 6: body parts info (em10ModelInit)`), and `ps2sym.py --struct` shows nothing on the PS2 side of
that row. Treat them as a description, not a fact; a rename from better evidence is welcome
(`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

### 3. Placeholders

`xNN` is a field at offset `0xNN` from the start of its struct whose meaning is unknown (for an
overlaid work such as `Em10Work` the offset is work-relative and the comment gives the absolute one).
`pad_NN[k]` is `k` bytes at offset `0xNN` that no code we have read touches. 120 `xNN` fields remain in
`include/` (2026-09-22, `rg -c '\bx[0-9A-Fa-f]{2,4};' include | awk -F: '{s+=$2} END{print s}'`; the
room and module work structs declared in `src/` have their own, `python3 tools/ps2sym.py --summary`
lists them per struct).
Names of this class carry no claim at all; the offset is the only information.

## Style: the vendor's spelling is kept

Names taken from the vendor are kept exactly as the vendor wrote them: `m_Pos`, `Wall_norm`, `Rno0`,
`be_flag`, `Timer2`, `TmpU32`. Capcom's own code mixes Hungarian prefixes, `Snake_case`, `camelCase`
and abbreviations; the mix in this tree is the mix in their source, not a style choice of ours. Renaming
a vendor identifier to a house style would destroy the one property the name has, which is that it is
the original.

Names we introduce (class 2) follow the surrounding struct: if the neighbours are `Timer`, `Timer2`,
`TmpF`, a new field is `TmpV`, not `tmp_vec`. Local variables in function bodies are ours unless the PS2
function signature supplied the parameter names (`ps2sym.py --params` renamed 434 functions'
parameters from it); they follow the same rule.

## `// COMPILER-DIFF:` tags and register pins

A `// COMPILER-DIFF: <n>` comment marks a construct that is there to make the compiler choose the same
register or schedule as the vendor's build, not to express program logic: a `register T x asm("rN")`
declaration, an empty `asm("")` with operand constraints, a dead test, a statement placed for its
side effect on the allocator. None of them emits an instruction. `python3 tools/asmcheck.py --all`
compiles every GCC unit with its asm templates marked and lists the instructions that came from a
template; the only hits are the paired-single, GQR, cache and exception-handler kernels the vendor also
wrote in assembly (231 instructions at 18 sites, unchanged since 2026-09-17). There are 578 tags and 103
`register ... asm("rN")` pins (2026-09-22). Each tag number is a mechanism explained in
`docs/matching.md` ("Known compiler-build differences", "Lever catalogue") and the pass-by-pass record
in `docs/research/`; `docs/research/compiler.md`, section "Asm-removal pass", records how the earlier hand-placed instructions were
replaced by C and which compiler pass each replacement relies on.

The CRI libraries (CodeWarrior) have the same thing in MWCC form: 28 codeless `asm { mr r11, x; mr x, r11 }`
and `asm { mr v, v }` blocks that the allocator deletes and that only narrow the register choice. One
block emits code: `DCT_AcInit` in `lib/dct_ac.c`, where the vendor's compiler build pooled the
function's 8-byte literals differently from ours (`docs/matching.md`, "MWCC compiler-build differences").

## Where to look

- `config/G4BE08/sym_map.tsv`, `config/G4BE08/modules/<mod>/sym_map.tsv`: the vendor's function names.
- `python3 tools/ps2sym.py --struct <Name>`: which fields of a struct are vendor names, which are ours.
- `python3 tools/ps2sym.py --summary`: per-header counts, structs with no PS2 counterpart.
- `docs/matching.md`: unit boundaries, tags, conventions. `docs/unit-notes.md`: per-unit notes.
