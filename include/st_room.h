// Shared by the stage room scripts (src/st1/, src/st2/, src/st4/). Nothing here emits code or data
// into .text/.rodata; the original room headers are unknown.

// Every original stage module carries a 0x34-byte COMMON block: uninitialised static data members
// that g++ 2.95 emits as `.comm` in every object, merged by the -r link and appended to .bss by
// snmakerel (tools/make_rel.py); their names are not in the binary. The generated skeleton calls the
// block `common_<mod>`, so the compiled rooms define the same symbol (REL_MODULE comes from
// configure.py) and the link keeps merging them into the one block whatever mix of split and
// compiled objects the module has.

// it may clobber `pG` / the room work pointer and reloads them afterwards, and keeps following
// loads below the store (see global.h BitOn). The rooms store into pG and their work this way.
